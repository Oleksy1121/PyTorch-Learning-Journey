## Introduction
This repository documents my journey of learning PyTorch, a popular framework for deep learning. It contains practical projects and experiments that I am undertaking as part of my educational process, exploring various concepts and techniques in machine learning and deep learning using PyTorch.

> Code is developed using the **Spyder** IDE (from the Anaconda distribution) and **Jupyter Notebooks**.
## Sources of Knowledge
I draw my knowledge and inspiration from the excellent courses created by **mrdbourke**. His tutorials and materials have significantly helped me understand PyTorch. I encourage you to check out his work:
- [mrdbourke's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning)
- [Learn PyTorch Website](https://www.learnpytorch.io)
